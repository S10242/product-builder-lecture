        <div class="content" style="text-align: left;">
            <p>Your privacy is important to us. It is Lotto Number Generator's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across our website.</p>
            
            <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
            <p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so – for example, to provide our services, to communicate with you, or to make our services better.</p>
            <p>We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we collect.</p>

            <h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>
            <p>We collect information that you provide to us directly. For example, we collect information when you participate in any interactive features of our services, fill out a form, or otherwise communicate with us.</p>
            
            <h3>Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
            <p>We also collect some information automatically:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Log Information:</strong> Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Information:</strong> We collect information about your usage of our services. For example, we collect information about the actions that users perform on our site.</li>
                <li><strong>Cookies & Other Similar Technologies:</strong> We use cookies and other similar technologies to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our services.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
            <p>We use information about you as mentioned above and for the purposes listed below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To provide, maintain, and improve our services;</li>
                <li>To monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our services;</li>
                <li>To personalize your experience;</li>
                <li>To detect, investigate, and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities and protect the rights and property of Lotto Number Generator and others.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Sharing Information</h2>
            <p>We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Lotto Number Generator, except in the following cases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>With your consent.</li>
                <li>For legal reasons.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>Our website may link to external sites that are not operated by us. Please be aware that we have no control over the content and practices of these sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy policies.</p>
            <p>We use third-party services, such as Google AdSense, which may use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to our website or other websites.
